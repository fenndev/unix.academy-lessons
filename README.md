# Unix Academy

Welcome to Unix Academy, a work-in-progress website intended to eventually be a comprehensive educational resource for Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including BSD, Linux, MacOS, and Android. At present, all text content available is derived from [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/), which licensed its course content under the [CC-BY-SA][cc-by-sa] and will be adapted here.


## Project History

Unix Academy is a spiritual successor to [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/), a website previously run by [CindyQ](https://github.com/cindyq). Linux Journey was an excellent educational resource, but it went on hiatus in early 2017 and has not been updated since. The intention behind Unix Academy is to build on Linux Journey's legacy and create an even more comprehensive and up-to-date resource for Unix learners.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. The original Linux Journey had translations available in 14 languages in addition to their English content, but as I am unable to verify the accuracy of content written in non-English languages, I have elected to not include them in this repository.
